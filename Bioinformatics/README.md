   * **Pre-Requisites** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : &nbsp; &nbsp;  Calculus, Linear Algebra, Python programming,Probability,   
                                     &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Introductory molecular biology
   * **Level** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : &nbsp; &nbsp; Advanced
   * **Course description**    
        This course introduces foundations and state-of-the-art machine learning challenges in genomics and the life sciences more broadly. The course introduces both deep learning and classical machine learning approaches to key problems, comparing and contrasting their power and limitations.
 

### 2. Computational Genomics
   * **Link to course** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: &nbsp; &nbsp; https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs262/
   * **Offered By** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: &nbsp; &nbsp; Stanford 
   * **Pre-Requisites** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : &nbsp; &nbsp; Design and Analysis of Algorithms  
   * **Level** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : &nbsp; &nbsp; Intermediate
   * **Course description**    
        Genomics is a new and very active application area of computer science. Computer science is playing a central role in genomics: from sequencing and assembling of DNA sequences to analyzing genomes in order to locate genes, similarities between sequences of different organisms, and several other applications. This course aims to present some of the most basic and useful algorithms for sequence analysis, together with the minimal biological background. Sequence alignments, hidden Markov models, multiple alignment algorithms and heuristics such as Gibbs sampling, and the probabilistic interpretation of alignments will be covered.        


### 3. The Human Genome Source Code
   * **Link to course** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: &nbsp; &nbsp; https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs273a/
   * **Offered By** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: &nbsp; &nbsp; Stanford 
   * **Pre-Requisites** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : &nbsp; &nbsp; Programming Experience in any language  
   * **Level** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : &nbsp; &nbsp; Beginner
   * **Course description**    
        The course introduces you to various aspects of genomic data . The course contents cover Population genomics & paternity testing, Medical AI (disease) genomics  and Comparative (evolutionary) genomics and maybe a dash of cryptogenomics and genomic privacy.
