<!-- ### 3. Computer Vision
   * **Link to course** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: &nbsp; &nbsp; https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~hays/compvision2021/
   * **Offered By** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: &nbsp; &nbsp; Georgia Tech 
   * **Pre-Requisites** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : &nbsp; &nbsp; Python programming, Calculus, Linear Algebra,Probability   
   * **Level** &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; : &nbsp; &nbsp; Advanced
   * **Course description**    
        This course provides an introduction to computer vision including fundamentals of image formation, camera imaging geometry, feature detection and matching, stereo, motion estimation and tracking, image classification and scene understanding. We'll explore methods for depth recovery from stereo images, camera calibration, automated alignment, tracking, boundary detection, and recognition. We'll use both classical machine learning and deep learning to approach these problems. The focus of the course is to develop the intuitions and mathematics of the methods in lecture, and then to learn about the difference between theory and practice in the projects.  -->
